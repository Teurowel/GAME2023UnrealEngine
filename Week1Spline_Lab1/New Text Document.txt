component -> Spline

Add new splie point -> Press Alt and drag point

MathExpression : any equation you want

Get distance between meshes based on number of mesh : Get Plint LEngth / number of meshes

Get location at distance along spline : based on distance between meshes, we can get location of meshes along spline and spawn static mesh

InstancedStaticMesh : optimaization

Add Spline Mesh Component : Bending PipeLine
